    <h1>Still_jekyll</h1>
<p>31 Aug 2019 - Dan</p>

<p>Still trying to get through the inital setup through a tutorial.</p>

<p>It seems likely that once I am done building templates and stylesheets, there are not going to be anymore tags.</p>

<p>I definitely propose that using an elm app to do this would be much better, only need to figure out how to encode posts and content.</p>
