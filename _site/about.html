<p>Hi! I am Dan. I think of myself as a Computer Science enthusiast who ended up, kind of by accident, working as a software developer.</p>

<p>I failed pathetically at CS in university - mostly because 18 year olds are bad at making life changing decisions - and ended up with a degree in Psychology that, as a de-facto engineer, I value a lot!</p>

<p>I like building things and solving problems. Sometimes the things I build solve problems.</p>
